This is a neural network which learns to predict who survived and who died on the titanic.
It's a feed-forward neural neural network and I use Relu activation fonction because it's fast to compute and it seem like "the default" activation fonction for feed-forward, I also use the logistic activation fonction to have a probability as final output
